Description:
Add full vectorbt backtesting with GUI-triggered parameter sweeps for strategy validation. Include sample strategies (e.g., scalping, arbitrage) with realistic signals, and export stats to CSV/Parquet.

Acceptance Criteria:
- run_vectorized supports param grids and returns stats per combo
- GUI panel to trigger sweeps and show summary metrics
- Results saved to data_cache/backtests/
